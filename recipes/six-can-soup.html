    <h1>Six Can Soup</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is an incredibly easy-to-make beef taco soup.
        I learned this recipe from a cool mom who had learned it from someone else.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can chili with no beans</li>
        <li>1 can whole kernel corn</li>
        <li>1 can tomato soup</li>
        <li>1 can vegetable soup</li>
        <li>1 can stewed tomatoes or diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies</li>
        <li>Some grated chees: mild cheddar, Mexican blend, or the like</li>
        <li>1 bag of Fritos</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All cans are standard size.
        For a milder variant of this soup, halve or omit the diced tomatoes
        with green chilies.
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Empty contents of all cans into a soup pot and mix together.
            Do not drain or reconstitute anything; just dump them in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat through on medium to high temperature, stirring occasionally.
            Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve as follows: put a handful of Fritos in each bowl.
            Pour soup on the Fritos, and then sprinkle grated cheese on top.
            I recommend milk to drink with this soup.
        </li>
    </ol>
