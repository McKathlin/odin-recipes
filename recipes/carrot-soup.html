    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The bright orange wonder. This recipe is inspired by Carol's Carrot Soup from the MMORPG
        Asheron's Call. I arrived at this receipe after a long series of experiments.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>5 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 to 1 &frac12; teaspoon basil leaves,to taste</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        <li>a squirt of ranch dressing (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine carrots and chicken broth in a 2 quart soup pot or slow cooker. Boil until carrots are soft.
            (This took my slow cooker 2-3 hours.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the carrots into a blender, add the milk, and blend until smooth.
            If the mixture is too thick to blend well, add some of the chicken broth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour contents of the blender back into the pot. Stir in all remaining Ingredients
            and heat through at low to medium temperature. (If the soup is too thick, add more milk
            until it reaches the desired consistency.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve. Optionally, sprinkle grated cheese on top.
            This soup pairs well with bread or toast.
        </li>
    </ol>
