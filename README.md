# odin-recipes
This is a sample static recipe site made as part of
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum,
as outlined [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The site is live on GitHub; you can visit it [here](https://mckathlin.github.io/odin-recipes/).

The site features three of my favorite recipes:
* Carrot Soup
* Jen's Jambalaya (sourced from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/133604/jens-jambalaya/))
* Six Can Soup

The Odin Project only calls for basic HTML on this project, but I've opted to give
this site some subtle CSS styling anyway. The style has a light mode and a dark mode
and conforms to the client browser's preferred color scheme.
